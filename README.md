# Pacman-in-different-realms-
This is a project in which our good old game Pacman game is updated to newer versions in which the Pacman reaches different realms  like ocean, forest and space, with super exciting features of teleportation and cheat codes. Basically, this is a game which takes you back to 90's but with fresh new experience of different realms.

This is a project created for grading in sem 2 as a mini-project for the course called PROBLEM SOLVING WITH C. 
So this is a program written only in C programming language using graphics.h

#WARNINGS 
This code will not work in any other coding platform except Turbo C as we have used graphics.h header file in this project which is not supported by other new coding platforms.
graphics.h is an outdated header file but very helpful for creating games in C.
So, if the code has to be executed elsewhere except Turbo C, it is recommended to build the game either using gui in python or Javascript.
